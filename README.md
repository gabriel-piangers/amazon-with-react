# Recreating amazon using Vite and React.js

A basic shopping e-commerce website with a home page, displaying all the products, a cart page containing all the products added to the cart and a orders and tracking page to display all the user orders.

I made this website to practice and learn about react and JavaScript, the whole application was based on the [supersimple.dev amazon project](https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon/), used in his JavaScript youtube course, which I completed and super recommend to begginer programmers. <br>
> No code has been copied, I only took inpiration on the application and the styling of his website for practice reasons only.

## Used tools and frameworks

JavaScript - main programming language <br>
React.js - JavaScript library for web development <br>
Vite - Build tool <br>
Tailwind CSS - Styling framework based on utility classes <br>

### Others libraries

React-router-dom - handling different routes in the application <br>
uuid - for ID genarating <br>
dayJS - for handling dates <br>

<hr>

With this small project I learned about react components, states, useEffects, API requests using fetch(), async/await functions, promisses, basic programming logic and data handling, responsive styling many other basic but essential tools and techniques used to create web applications.
