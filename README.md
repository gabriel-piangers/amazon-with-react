# Amazon Clone with Vite & React  

A simple e-commerce website featuring:  
- 🏠 **Home Page** – Displays all available products  
- 🛍️ **Cart Page** – Shows items added to the cart  
- 📦 **Orders & Tracking Page** – Displays user orders and tracking details  

## 🎯 About This Project  
This project was built to practice and strengthen my skills in React and JavaScript. It is inspired by the [SuperSimple.Dev Amazon Project](https://supersimple.dev/projects/amazon/) from their JavaScript YouTube course, which I highly recommend for beginner programmers.

> 🚨 **Note:** No code was copied. The application structure and styling were used purely as inspiration for learning purposes.
